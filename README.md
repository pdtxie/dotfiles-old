dotfiles for:
- waybar
- wayfire
- foot csd
- albert
- nvim
- zsh

waybar requires:
- pulseaudio (+you'll probably want pavucontrol for gui)
- fontawesome icons
- deepin icon theme

wayfire:
- keybinds are mostly the same as macos
- i've tried to make the trackpad gestures as macos-like as possible - still needs work but getting there
- uses brillo, grim, slurp, wl-copy and wl-recorder 

cursor theme is a modified bibata-ice theme to match the theme colour ([can be found here](https://github.com/ful1e5/Bibata_Cursor))
theme used for all configs is [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin)
